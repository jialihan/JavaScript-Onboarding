        data-allow-toggle
          Always allow in this code
        
        data-allow-multiple
          Allow for multiple accordion sections to be expanded at the same time. Assumes data-allow-toggle otherwise the toggle on open sections would be disabled.

                        Generating random paragraphs can be an excellent way for writers to get their creative flow
                        going at the beginning of the day. The writer has no idea what topic the random paragraph will
                        be about when it appears. This forces the writer to use creativity to complete one of three
                        common writing challenges. The writer can use the paragraph as the first one of a short story
                        and build upon it. A second option is to use the random paragraph somewhere in a short story
                        they create.

            <h3>
                <button aria-expanded="false" class="Accordion-trigger" aria-controls="sect2" id="accordion2id">
                    <span class="Accordion-title">
                        Section 2
                        <span class="Accordion-icon"></span>
                    </span>
                </button>
            </h3>
            <div id="sect2" role="region" aria-labelledby="accordion2id" class="Accordion-panel" hidden="">
                <div>
                    <p>A random paragraph can also be an excellent way for a writer to tackle writers' block. Writing
                        block can often happen due to being stuck with a current project that the writer is trying to
                        complete. By inserting a completely random paragraph from which to begin, it can take down some
                        of the issues that may have been causing the writers' block in the first place.</p>

                        No! All of the paragraphs in the generator are written by humans, not computers. When first
                        building this generator we thought about using computers to generate the paragraphs, but they
                        weren't very good and many times didn't make any sense at all. We therefore took the time to
                        create paragraphs specifically for this generator to make it the best that we could.
