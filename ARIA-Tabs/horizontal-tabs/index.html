                Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea
                species. When coffee berries turn from green to bright red in color – indicating ripeness – they are
                picked, processed, and dried.[2] Dried coffee seeds (referred to as "beans") are roasted to varying
                degrees, depending on the desired flavor.

                Coca-Cola, or Coke, is a carbonated soft drink manufactured by The Coca-Cola Company. Originally
                marketed as a temperance drink and intended as a patent medicine, it was invented in the late 19th
                century by John Stith Pemberton and was bought out by businessman Asa Griggs Candler, whose marketing
                tactics led Coca-Cola to its dominance of the world soft-drink market throughout the 20th century.
